- 👋 Hi, I’m [Name used to be here - but is now]  NO LONGER INTERESTED IN THE SUICIDAL RAT RACE THAT IS .Net or Javascript (Or Rust or any new weekly programming language or operating system or build system  that appears EVERY GODDAMN day on this space
- 👀 I’m interested in ...anything else but the above and not whatever any of those people think
- 🌱 I’m currently learning ... definitely NOT self control as the state of computing appears to be on a spectacular downnward spiral as one cannot trust crap that is created nowadays. All their stuff is doing is creating pollution. So now to find answers with regards to code i have to sift through thousands of lines of "I wrote a programming language and OS in 1 day and its faster than C bullshit. Sorry.. but im too old for that type of shit.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ... nothing with any of the above people. where Im going, none of this daily new fangled way of doing computing shit will be tolerated as the crew are all over the age of 70 and deserves respect. So keep you latest framework with new build system that has 1000000 lines of code you "wrote" in 1 day for away from me. Im REALLY not interested.
- 📫 How to reach me ?... reach me.... and my foot will reach for your nuts.
